            perspectives. This experience not only encourages curiosity and open-mindedness but also builds a strong
            sense of connection among everyone involved. By the end of camp, many new friendships have been formed, old
            friendships have grown even stronger, and participants leave with lasting memories and a deeper appreciation
            for the communities they represent.</p>
